## Sass flexbox mixin
This is a set of mixins for those who want to mess
around with flexbox using the native support of current
browsers. For full support table check: http://caniuse.com/flexbox

Basically this will use:
- Fallback, old syntax (IE10, mobile webkit browsers - no wrapping)
- Final standards syntax (FF, Safari, Chrome, IE11, Opera)

## Installation
#### Bower

`bower install sass-flex-mixin`
