# Brevada Front-end Framework

## Introduction

Brevada's front-end framework is a raw javascript version of typical component-based front-end frameworks. We don't use an existing framework (such as Backbone.js, Angular.js...) because we need complete flexibility to control all stages of fetching data and rendering DOM elements.

## Warning

The plus-side to a pure javascript implementation is the flexibility and control, but the obvious down-side is the potential for a lack of organization and messy code. It is therefore very important that we stick to strict conventions.
